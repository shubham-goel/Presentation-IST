Introduction
------------
Our goal is to send a collection of messages throughout a network of switches. We model the network as a directed graph. Each message has a source and target vertex. Hardware limitations allow sending only one message at every time step on an edge.

Initial Work
------------
Before us, faults were usually handled by the application layer using redundant messages. Finding a TT schedule is very costly, and redundancy only makes the problem harder.

Also be thought of as a saboteur game:
runner moves tokens on a network and saboteur tries to crash links

Handling New faults

Explain a bit more

What Next
---------
view scoring as "model checking" and finding good message priorities as "synthesis" or "partial synthesis"
